      <p class="test">this is probably the best experience you'll ever have so have fun browsing
        trough our website Nairobi is a city full of contrasts. It's old enough so you can feel
        its past and multi-ethnic enough so you can experience Kenyan culture, yet it's modern
        enough to get Internet access. It's a city that blends people from all cultures and walks
        of life. Adorned with modern skyscrapers, world class restaurants, fully equipped hospitals,
        modern shopping malls, schools, abundant private and public
        transportation, and universities and colleges that provide local and international curriculum
        - you will find it all in Nairobi.</p>
